<p>Springing Ahead</p>

<p>Here are some quick updates on what’s been happening at GroupGets over the past quarter. Our first campaign for the FLIR Lepton is now in its 6th public round and has shipped over 1000 units globally. Thanks again to everyone who helped to make it a success. We have since expanded our offerings from FLIR and have also picked up Hamamatsu Photonic as a manufacturing partner. Stay tuned for more products from new partners that are currently making their way to the platform.</p>

<p>New campaigns going forward will now benefit from cheaper international shipping. It took time to experiment with different platforms and methods but we found the right solution that yields reliable shipping at the best cost.</p>

<p>We hired a new software engineer, Matthew Navarro, who has been busy enhancing our site experience. Matthew is also an editor at Overclock.net and adds a great mix of essential talents to the team.</p>

<p>We look forward enabling more innovation and democratized access worldwide. We’ve only just begun and don’t forget, you can take part too by creating your own campaigns to hack high MOQ’s.</p>

<p>Happy Hacking.</p>

<p>Today I had the chance to use the recently released FLIR Pocketcam GUI with my FLIR Lepton PocketCam. Video walkthrough below.</p>

<p>I encountered only one problem during the driver installation on my Windows workstation, the drivers being unsigned means that you have to disable Driver Signature Enforcement.</p>

<p>Below are the steps to temporarily disable this in Windows 8/8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2:</p>

<p>First press Restart while holding down the shift key</p>

<p>You will see the following screen after your computer has restarted. Select troubleshoot</p>

<p>Then click startup settings</p>

<p>Now restart again</p>

<p>On Windows Server 2012 you will see the screen on the left, choose Disable Driver Signature Enforcement. On Windows 8/8.1 you will see the screen on the right, press 7</p>

<p>Windows will now start up with driver signature enforcement disabled until the next restart.</p>

<p>Now you can install the driver. Instructions on how to install the driver are provided in this file “PocketCam_UserInstallation_Guide(WINDOWS).pdf”.</p>

<p>After I completed the driver setup I ran “FC_USB.exe” in the Software folder then turned on and plugged in my FLIR Lepton PocketCam into my workstation.</p>

<p>Pressed start… It works!</p>

<p>Overall getting everything set up and running was easy with minimal problems.</p>

<p>If you have been using the GUI share what you are doing with it and your Lepton in the comments!</p>

<p>Today is an exciting milestone for the GroupGets team and its partners. We just closed our first campaign to bring a cutting-edge component directly from the manufacturer to small and independent developers throughout the world to give them access to something otherwise unattainable.</p>

<p>At the flir-lepton@googlegroups.com portal setup by Pure Engineering, we are already seeing collaboration and ideas flow before people even have their Leptons. Some of our friends have been updating the sample code at the Github repo so that the campaign backers have great building blocks on multiple platforms by the time that they get their Leptons.</p>

<p>The factory order was placed a few days ago and we expect to have units to ship to everyone in less than a week. For those who ordered the breakout boards at Tindie.com, over 100 have been produced and are in transit now to us. Many more are also going to be produced for subsequent batches so if your friends missed out or if you need more, The Lepton Batch 2 campaign is already open.</p>

<p>From the bottom of our hearts we thank everyone that helped to make this a success and we hope that this is just the beginning for this platform. We definitely have more exciting things planned as we ramp up.</p>

<p>Please note that the platform exists to enable anyone to initiate secure group buys online for anything. Since we are makers ourselves, our sponsored group buys will mostly be maker-focused, but the platform is not limited to that. Alternatively, if you are a producer of great products wanting to reach a global aggregation of smaller yet motivated makers, we want to hear from you because we know that we can help.</p>
